Client Side Chat App That Uses reegbase (My MVP for Firebase)

[reegbase](https://github.com/selfup/reegbase) uses [selfup-rejs](https://github.com/selfup/rejs) (an npm package I made) that is a databse based in node that writes JSON to files through websockets.

I hooked up my own database to websockets to make a chat app on the client!

I also ported this over to AngularJS 1.5.3: [angularChat](https://github.com/selfup/angularChat) with a whooping 23 lines of Javascript and 23 lines of HTML. Kind of awesome!
