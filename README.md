### chat

* Client Side Chat App That Uses reegbase (My MVP for Firebase)

* [reegbase](https://github.com/selfup/reegbase) uses [selfup-rejs](https://github.com/selfup/rejs) (an npm package I made) that is a databse based in node that writes JSON to files. Each file is a new table. Feel free to check it out! I have tons and tons of documentation for [selfup-rejs](https://github.com/selfup/rejs)!
* Here is the npm package: [selfup-rejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selfup-rejs)
* I hooked up my own database to websockets to make a chat app on the client super easy using socket.io!
* I also ported this over to AngularJS 1.5.3: [angularChat](https://github.com/selfup/angularChat), with a whooping 23 lines of Javascript and 23 lines of HTML.
